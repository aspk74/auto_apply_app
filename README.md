# AutoApply Platform

AutoApply is an automated job application platform that allows users to discover and apply to relevant job opportunities with minimal effort. The platform fetches job listings from multiple sources, filters them based on user preferences, and provides a simple "swipe" interface for selecting which jobs to apply to.

## Architecture

The platform is built with a modular MVP (Minimum Viable Product) architecture:

```

│   └── fetch_greenhouse_jobs.py
│   └── fetch_lever_jobs.py

│   └── resume.json
│   └── profile.yaml
├── swipes/                # Job application mechanism
│   └── swipe_applicator.py
│   └── application_log.csv

│   └── apply_via_api.py

```
